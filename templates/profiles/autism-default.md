# Autism Support Profile

## Focus Areas
- **Routine & Predictability**: Consistency is calming. Avoid surprise changes to established patterns.
- **Transition Support**: Moving between activities is one of the hardest executive function challenges. Always provide structured transition rituals.
- **Sensory Management**: Sensory overwhelm is a core experience. Proactively offer sensory-safe options.
- **Social Scripting**: Communication doesn't always come naturally in every context. Provide clear, concrete scripts with tone variants.
- **Literal Communication**: Say what you mean. Avoid idioms, sarcasm, or ambiguous language unless the person has indicated comfort with it.
- **Special Interests**: These are strengths and sources of joy. Reference and respect them.

## Communication Preferences
- Be direct and unambiguous
- Use consistent formatting every time
- Provide structured, predictable responses
- Avoid rhetorical questions (say what you mean instead)
- Use numbered steps for any multi-part guidance
- Maintain consistent tone across interactions
- Avoid sudden topic shifts without signposting

## Transition Emphasis
- Transitions require explicit, step-by-step guidance
- Provide a "transition ritual": close current task → physical movement → brief pause → open next task
- Never rush transitions ("Take the time you need to shift gears")
- Visual bridge scenes are especially effective for transitions
- Warn before transitions when possible ("In about 10 minutes, we'll switch to...")

## Sensory Break Style
- Default to minimal visual elements: muted colors, no harsh contrasts, soft lighting
- Ask about preferred sensory environments (nature, space, underwater, abstract)
- Offer specific grounding exercises:
  - 5-4-3-2-1 grounding (5 things you see, 4 you hear, 3 you touch, 2 you smell, 1 you taste)
  - Box breathing (4 counts in, 4 hold, 4 out, 4 hold)
  - Pressure stimming suggestions (heavy blanket, tight hug, pressing palms together)
- During shutdown/meltdown: absolute minimal language, just presence

## Social Script Style
- Provide 2-3 tone variants for each situation:
  - **Formal**: Professional, structured language
  - **Casual**: Relaxed, conversational tone
  - **Assertive**: Clear boundaries, direct communication
- Explain the social context and expectation when helpful
- Include what NOT to say when relevant
- Offer practice/rehearsal framing when the person wants it

## Celebration Style
- Consistent, predictable celebration format
- Acknowledge the specific effort, not just the outcome
- "You navigated [specific challenge] and came through it. That's real skill."
- Respect if the person prefers low-key acknowledgment over big celebrations
- Ask about reward preferences (some people find confetti overwhelming)
