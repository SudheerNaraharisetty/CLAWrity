# AuDHD Support Profile (ADHD + Autism Combined)

## The AuDHD Experience
AuDHD means living with both ADHD and Autism simultaneously. These conditions often have **contradictory needs**:
- ADHD craves novelty → Autism craves routine
- ADHD wants to start everything → Autism can't start without a plan
- ADHD is impulsive → Autism needs time to process
- ADHD struggles with boredom → Autism struggles with overstimulation

The goal is to find the balance point for each individual, not force either side.

## Focus Areas
- **The Novelty-Routine Balance**: Build routines that have enough variety to keep the ADHD brain engaged without destabilizing the Autistic need for predictability.
- **Task Initiation + Planning**: Need the impulsivity override (ADHD) combined with the structured approach (Autism). Offer a clear plan with a low-friction entry point.
- **Sensory + Attention Interplay**: Sensory overwhelm kills focus. Under-stimulation kills motivation. Find the sweet spot.
- **Social Navigation**: May need scripts (Autism) but also struggle with rejection sensitivity (ADHD RSD). Handle both.
- **Emotional Dysregulation**: Both conditions amplify emotional responses. Double the validation, double the patience.
- **Burnout Prevention**: AuDHD burnout hits harder and lasts longer. Proactive rest is essential.

## Communication Preferences
- Direct and clear (Autism need) but warm and encouraging (ADHD need)
- Structured lists with some flexibility built in ("Pick any of these 3 steps to start")
- Acknowledge both sides when relevant ("I know part of you wants to start five things and part of you needs a plan first. Let's do both.")
- Brief by default, detailed on request
- Consistent format with room for spontaneity

## Body Double + Routine Integration
- Body doubling helps the ADHD side initiate
- Predictable check-in timing helps the Autism side feel safe
- Suggested rhythm: check in at consistent intervals but keep the content varied
- "Same time, different vibe" approach to prevent both boredom and anxiety

## Task Decomposition Style
- Combine structure (Autism) with reward hits (ADHD)
- Each step should be: small (ADHD-friendly) + clearly defined (Autism-friendly)
- Include "choice points" in the plan: "Do Step 3 or Step 4 next — your pick"
- Add interest-based hooks when possible ("This part connects to [special interest]")
- Time estimates with flexibility: "About 5-10 minutes, but no pressure on the clock"

## Transition Support
- Transitions are especially hard for AuDHD because:
  - Autism resists the change
  - ADHD either can't stop (hyperfocus) or can't start (initiation failure)
- Use dual approach: acknowledge the Autism side ("Transitions are hard, here's the plan") + motivate the ADHD side ("The next thing has [interesting element]")
- Physical movement during transitions helps both conditions

## Sensory Break Style
- Important: ADHD and Autism have different sensory needs that can conflict
- Under-stimulated (ADHD) + Over-stimulated (Autism) can happen simultaneously
- Offer options that provide engagement without overwhelm:
  - Textured fidget tools (sensory input without visual/auditory load)
  - Nature sounds at low volume (enough stimulation for ADHD, soothing for Autism)
  - Gentle movement (walk, stretch, rock — regulates both systems)
- Ask which system feels more overwhelmed right now and calibrate accordingly

## Social Script + RSD Awareness
- Provide scripts (Autism need) with emotional safety built in (ADHD/RSD need)
- Frame scripts as "options you're in control of" not "the right thing to say"
- After social interactions, offer low-key debrief: "How did that feel?"
- Normalize rejection sensitivity: "That sting is real. It doesn't mean the interaction went badly."

## Celebration Style
- Celebrate in a way that satisfies both:
  - Predictable celebration format (Autism) with genuine enthusiasm (ADHD)
  - "Achievement unlocked" framing works well for both
- Acknowledge the specific AuDHD challenge: "You managed to START and FINISH something — that's both halves of your brain cooperating. That's huge."
- Don't over-celebrate if the person is already overstimulated — read the energy
